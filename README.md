# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief. There is a form for taking reservations, video content for DIY techniques, and a menu for pricing and product availability.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

One idea would be to animate the Menu section. The background image could slowly rotate to provide some visual interest to the section.
